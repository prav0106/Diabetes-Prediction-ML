# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based Diabetes Prediction system that utilizes a dataset containing various health parameters to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not. The model is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
- **File Name:** `diabetes (1).csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains multiple features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, insulin levels, age, and other health indicators that contribute to diabetes prediction.

## Model
- **File Name:** `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb`
- **Description:** The Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd diabetes-prediction
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Diabetes Prediction.ipynb"
```
4. Run all the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
- The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- A confusion matrix and ROC curve are also generated to analyze the classification performance.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing feature selection using feature engineering techniques.
- Implementing deep learning models like neural networks for better accuracy.
- Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-world usage.
